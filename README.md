# UNICEF-Activity-File-Albania-Analysys
This repository pertains to a job task for the position of Data Analyst at Open Data Services Co-op. The scenario involves working with data standards.

The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has committed to publishing high-quality IATI data. They have made their activity files available through the IATI Registry[https://iatiregistry.org/publisher/unicef], and their content can be viewed on d-portal[https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=search&reporting_ref=XM-DAC-41122]. 

The system has created a set of validation reports. Looking at the report for Albania you can see that there are some errors. Your role is to help them improve the quality of their data. 

We would like you to:

1.	Look at the Validation report for the Albania activities from IATI Validator[https://validator.iatistandard.org/report/unicef-albania].
2.	Choose two or three feedback items 
3.	Research what each error means and how they can be fixed

To help you with this task you can also download the data/link and run it through the IATI Cove at https://iati.cove.opendataservices.coop/ for more details about the errors. Additionally, you can edit the files locally and validate your edited activities using the IATI Validator or IATI CoVE. You can also look at the IATI Standard Website for more information at https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/. 

Draft an email (max: 500 words) with your key feedback for the team and send it to m****@codeyourfuture.io.

Note that there are no right or wrong answers in this exercise. We’re interested in exploring what you would look for when assessing data, and what types of feedback you think would be important to share with the publisher.
